This project utilizes statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic. It includes exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis to identify significant predictors, and the development of a Random Forest Classifier model. The project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, statistical techniques, and machine learning model development.
Developed a simple Power BI Dashboard contains some visualizations.
